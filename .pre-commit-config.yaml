# This file defines hooks that will run automatically before commits.
# To install pre-commit and enable hooks on Windows, follow these steps:

# 1. Install Python (required to run pre-commit)
#    On Windows, the recommended way is to use the Python Install Manager (Beta)
#    available via the Microsoft Store app.

# 2. Install pre-commit:
#    Run:
#      py -m pip install pre-commit
#    This ensures you use the correct Python environment.

# 3. Install git hooks for this repository:
#    Run:
#      py -m pre_commit install

# 4. To run hooks on all files and check which are active, run:
#    py -m pre_commit run --all-files --verbose

# 5. To update hooks to their latest versions, run:
#    py -m pre_commit autoupdate
#    Then commit the updated '.pre-commit-config.yaml'.

# 6. Install ShellCheck on Windows (required for the shellcheck hook):
#    ShellCheck is not bundled with the hook and must be installed separately.
#    On Windows, install it using winget (restart required):
#      winget install --id=koalaman.shellcheck
#
#    Make sure the installation directory is in your system PATH environment variable
#    so that pre-commit can locate the shellcheck executable.

# Note:
# - If your PATH does not include the Python Scripts directory,
#   always prefix Python commands with `py -m` (e.g., `py -m pre_commit run`).
#
# - Maven must be installed and in PATH for the mvn-checkstyle hook to work.
#   Adjust or remove this hook if Maven is not available.
