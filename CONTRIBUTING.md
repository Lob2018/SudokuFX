## 3. Development Setup

### üõ† Prerequisites

- Java 21+
- Git
- No need to install Maven manually ‚Äî we use the **Maven Wrapper** (`./mvnw`)
- Recommended IDE: **IntelliJ IDEA**

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Build and Run

We provide preconfigured **Run Configurations** in the `.idea/runConfigurations/` directory.

> ‚úÖ **Please use these configurations instead of running Maven manually.**

They are designed to:

- Automatically run `mvn clean` followed by the appropriate goal (`javafx:run`, `package`, etc.)
- Ensure the project is rebuilt from a clean state
- Trigger the **Spotless plugin** during the `validate` and `compile` phases
- Enforce consistent code formatting automatically

### üß≠ Available Run Configurations

| Name                                                                 | Description                                                                 |

| `SudokuFX [run with details]`                                       | Same as above, but with verbose output and Prism debug flags               |
| `SudokuFX [package]`                                                | Builds the project using `clean package`                                   |
| `SudokuFX [test]`                                                   | Runs the test suite using `clean test`                                     |
| `SudokuFX [Jmh init.]`                                              | Compiles benchmarks with the `jmh` profile                                 |
| `SudokuFX [DOC Doxygen Unix+LICENSE.txt]`                           | Generates Unix-style Doxygen docs with license                             |
| `SudokuFX [DOC Doxygen Windows+LICENSE.txt]`                        | Generates Windows-style Doxygen docs with license                          |
| `SudokuFX [Update parent, plugins, dependencies, and NVD check]`    | Updates Maven parent, plugins, dependencies, and runs OWASP vulnerability check |

To use them:

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Go to the **Run** menu ‚Üí **Edit Configurations**.
3. Select one of the predefined entries listed above.
4. Click **Run** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to launch or build the project.

> üßº These configurations help enforce formatting rules and prevent build issues due to unformatted code.

---

## 4. Coding Standards and Formatting

- We use **Google Java Format v1.27.0** with **AOSP style**.
- Formatting is enforced via the **Spotless Maven Plugin**.
- Code must be formatted before submission.

> ‚úÖ **Spotless is automatically triggered** when using the provided IntelliJ IDEA Run Configurations
> (see [‚ñ∂Ô∏è Build and Run](#Ô∏è-build-and-run)). These configurations always start with `mvn clean`,
> which ensures Spotless runs during the `validate` and `compile` phases.

### Formatting commands (optional if using Run Configurations):

```bash
./mvnw spotless:apply     # Apply formatting
./mvnw spotless:check     # Check formatting compliance
```

> ‚ùó Unformatted code will fail the build or be rejected during review.

## 5. Testing Guidelines

- ‚úÖ **All new features and bug fixes must include appropriate unit or integration tests.**
- Use **JUnit 5** for unit tests and **TestFX** for JavaFX UI testing.
- Run tests locally before submitting:

```bash
./mvnw test
```
### Test Policy for New Functionality

As a general policy, any major new functionality must be accompanied by automated tests.
This ensures that new features are reliable, maintainable, and do not introduce regressions.
Pull Requests that introduce significant changes without tests may be rejected or delayed.

Tests should cover:

- Core logic and edge cases
- Input validation and error handling
- UI behavior (if applicable)

If you're unsure how to test a specific feature, feel free to open a draft PR or ask for guidance in your Pull Request description.

---

## 6. Commit Message Guidelines

We use a standardized commit message template to keep our Git history clean, readable, and consistent.

### üìÑ Commit Template

A commit message template is provided in the root of the repository:

```
.gitmessage
```

To activate it locally, run:

```bash
git config --local commit.template .gitmessage
```

To verify it's correctly set:

```bash
git config --get commit.template
```

### ‚úÖ Commit Types

Uncomment the appropriate line in the template and write your message after the prefix.
Here are the supported commit types:
