>### Required Application Properties to Run
>
>For the application to work properly, the following application properties must be set at the JVM level:
>
>- app.name:This property specifies the name of the application.
>- app.version:This property specifies the version of the application.
   >   - This SemVer-like format is only numeric MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.0, 2.1.3).
>- app.organization: Specifies the organization responsible for the application.
>- app.license: Specifies the license under which the application is distributed.

### How to develop on Windows with IntelliJ IDEA

- Download and install [the LTS version of the Adoptium Temurin JDK Downloads](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jdk)
- Download and install [WiX Toolset v3.11](https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases/tag/wix3112rtm) (in order to package the application)
    - Activate .NET framework 3.5.1 (Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features > Turn Windows features on or off)
    - Launch wix311.exe
- Configured the necessary environment variables
    - JDK
        - name:JAVA_HOME
        - value LTS (e.g. 21):C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-21.0.3.9-hotspot
    - WiX
        - name:WIX
        - value:C:\Program Files (x86)\WiX Toolset v3.11\
- IntelliJ IDEA
    - Clone the repository
    - Select the project's JDK
        - File > Project Structure > SDK > Add SDK from disk (select the JDK)
    - Run Maven configurations (in the top right corner)
        - SudoMain.java is the main class
        - Maven run configurations are saved as project files in .idea/runConfigurations
            - Temporary performance evaluation with Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH):
                1. Comment out `<excludeGroupIds>org.openjdk.jmh</excludeGroupIds>`
                   and `<exclude>fr/softsf/sudokufx/benchmark/**/*.java</exclude>` in the `pom.xml`
                2. Run `mvn clean` and execute the `[Jmh init.]` configuration
                3. Manage your benchmark tests in the `fr.softsf.sudokufx.benchmark` package
                4. **Once benchmarking is complete, uncomment `<excludeGroupIds>org.openjdk.jmh</excludeGroupIds>`
                   and `<exclude>fr/softsf/sudokufx/benchmark/**/*.java</exclude>` in the `pom.xml`**
